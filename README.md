# Jäger - Java Edition
Lol that sounds like Minecraft.

This is the Java version of the Python version of Jäger. The reason I chose to rewrite
it in Java is because it allows me to not only increase performance but also, I get to
micromanage everything which I like. Also, I get to learn a new language which is always
a plus. How long it'll be until this is running in production? A while. It needs to have
all of the functionalities of the Python version and some.

If I can get this all done in under a month @MagnumBong you are paying for me to go to
Five Guys.
